2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.026 ns between u_ppc/count_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clock_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0) and u_ppc/count_reg[23]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clock_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.047 ns between u_ppc/count_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clock_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0) and u_ppc/count_reg[21]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clock_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
